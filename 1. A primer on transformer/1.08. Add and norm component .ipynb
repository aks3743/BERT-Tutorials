    "One more important component in our encoder is the add and norm. It connects the input and output of a sublayer. That is, as shown in the following figure (dotted lines), we can observe that add and norm component: \n",

    "The add and norm component is basically a residual connection followed by layer normalization. Layer normalization promotes faster training by preventing the values in each layer from changing heavily. \n",
